                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>As a startup company, we built this idea from our own needs. “Too lazy to type on the phone.” “Sometimes I want to keep my hands-free”. These daily scenarios inspired us to create the voice-based messenger, OneTalk.</p>
                  <h3>Stage One - Improve current voice messaging experience</h3>
                  <p>In the beginning, we applied current speech-recognition services and try to improve the usability for sending voice messages. People send message in two ways: text or voice message. However, senders and receivers aren’t necessarily  in compatible  environments. They might not be able to type by hand or hear your voice on speaker. What if we could display both text and voice together? Be able to hear the voice can also better to understand the emotion of a person. It can eliminate the misunderstanding from text-only messages.</p>
                  <h5>Automatic voice-to-text transcription completes the messaging experience.</h5>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/01_stage1.png" alt="">
                  <h5>Advanced features to fit various occasions.</h5>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/01_stage1-1.png" alt="">
                  <h3>Stage Two - Expand Voice Typing Use Case</h3>
                  <p>One user on Google Play suggested expanding our service for uses outside OneTalk, such as gaming. So we moved the experience beyond the app. This is how the Chat Bubbles feature started.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/01_stage2.png" alt="">
                  <h3>Stage Three - Merge Instant-Messaging Services into OneTalk</h3>
                  <p>People have many different instant messengers on their phones. Having to switch between apps to reply to messages is a hassle. We created a solution to reply to all incoming messages with OneTalk Chat Bubbles for leading instant-messaging platforms, such as SMS, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and others. This made the Chat Bubbles feature much more useful and it also helped us to promote the app every time a user replies to a message.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/01_stage3.png" alt="">
                  <h3>Iterations</h3>
                  <p>After the main features were successfully integrated, we focused on optimizing the usability of the Chat Bubbles feature. Using Google Analytics data, we were able to determine which functions users tended to favor. We also added pre-written messages to let users reply with common responses even more quickly.</p>

                  <h2>OneTalk Bot</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">OneTalk Bot includes a service, featuring three unique chatbots. Our goal was to explore various service possibilities through conversational user interface and to provide a delightful, friendly experience to attract more users and to engage them more deeply and enjoyably.</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/02-chatbot overview.png" alt="">
                  <h3>Mr.Otter</h3>
                  <p>When users first enter OneTalk, they meet Mr. Otter. The purpose of the Mr. Otter chatbot is to provide tutorials and customer support. Users can talk to Mr. Otter and test the voice recognition. We also used Wizard of Oz method to chat with users and learn from them.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/02-otter screenshot.png" alt="">
                  <h5>Insights from the chat Log</h5>
                  <p>Looking at the chat log helped us better understand our users. It also helped us design better interaction through conversational user interface.</p>
                  <h5>Say hi to your users</h5>
                  <p>To make a good first impression with users, saying “Hi” to users is an critical step. Randomized ways to say “Hi” have been proven to . We found many users enjoyed clicking on the bot just for fun.</p>
                  <h5>Always response the user</h5>
                  <p>Users hate to be ignored. Even if the bot cannot satisfy everything a user might need, having it say “sorry” or provide further contact info is still helpful.</p>
                  <h5>Bot abuse</h5>
                  <p>It’s common for users to swear at, curse, or otherwise verbally abuse bots. Programming words and phrases and teaching the bot to reply politely can alleviate negative user interactions.</p>
                  <h5>Valuable thoughts from target users</h5>
                  <p>Although our design team is in our 30s, most of our target users are teenagers, and it was hard to know their thoughts without speaking to them directly. We used the Mr. Otter channel to conduct deeper interviews with them. We learned how they interact with friends by messaging, popular YouTube channels among their peers, and the most used social media. This data helped us to better promote OneTalk on the marketing side.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Magic DJ</h3>
                  <p>Given the rise of music-video streaming on YouTube, we decided to build MagicDJ for optimizing experience on the site. After requesting music from MagicDJ, a pop-up floating windows on the screen (Android phone-only), even you leave the OneTalk app. MagicDJ also recommends playlists proactively through conversational user interface. This feature was highly praised from our users. However, we wanted to explore more possibilities. This was where the idea for the Music Remote feature originated.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/02-dj screenshot.png" alt="">
                  <h5>MagicDJ + ChatBubbles + AI = Music Remote</h5>
                  <p>Having built MagicDJ and Chat Bubbles on OneTalk, we wondered: What if you could send commands from  instant messengers to control Magic DJ?</p>
                  
                  <!--
                  <h5>Why Music Remote</h5>
                  <ul class="list-inline">
                    <li>1. Music Remote transforms your (spare) phone into a smart speaker.</li>
                    <li>2. Friends are able to remotely control music at a party from their instant messengers without installing OneTalk.</li>
                    <li>3. Music Remote  saves you money by removing the need to purchase  additional voice-control devices, such as Echo.</li>

                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>ZenUI is the user interface designed for ZenFone. Before the 2014 release of ZenFone1, ASUS design center needed to create their own user interface. At the time, the design guidelines for Android phones were incomplete. I was involved in creating the ZenUI user interface, and focused on planning and designing the essential multimedia application for ZenFone.</p>

                  <h3>Challenges</h3>
                  <p>Timing: Our team was under a tight deadline—two to three months—for building the new application from scratch.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Integration: We wanted to support most cloud-storage services and, home-storage services (such as NAS) so that users could easily access their multimedia files. We also want to support various streaming technologies. Our main design goal was to integrate these features into the user flow and make users feel comfortable.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Communication: Unlike third-party applications, all ZenFone app interactions need to be consistent and unified. Designers on ZenFone apps needed to cooperate closely and effectively to achieve our goal.</p>

                  <h3>ASUS Music</h3>
                  <p>We built the ASUS Music application, which allowed users to easily access music files on cloud resource, also providing song lyrics and streaming features.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://goo.gl/pMYnmA">Try it on Google Play Store</a></p>

                  <h3>ASUS MicroFilm</h3>
                  <p>To better promote the new ZenFone camera, we were also asked to build the MicroFilm application for creating photo videos. By selecting different themes and customized background music, MicroFilm users could create stylish and immersive slideshow movies.</p>

                  <h3>ASUS Gallery</h3>
                  <p>We also needed to redesign and update the Gallery application to be consistent with the other new or redesigned ZenFone apps. Our redesigned Gallery provided photo photo viewing and advanced editing to make photo sharing more fun and engaging!</p>

                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>In the loud environments, such as inside a moving vehicle, a regular phone's microphone is less effective for voice control. Kika developed a noise-cancellation microphone built into a USB-charging cable to solve this problem. With Kika's cutting-edge AI engine, the KikaGo application created a truly hands-free means for communications inside a car environment that is also elegant and simple.</p>

                  <h3>Challenges</h3>
                  <p>At the time of KikaGo’s development, there were no hands-free, in-car communications on the market. Unlike existing voice-assisted agents like Siri, KikaGo was designed specifically for voice interaction and hands-free communication so that users would be able to interact without seeing or touching the screen. Because of this, the design flow would need to be more abstract and difficult than the conventional user interface, which includes a visual component, and designers would need to spend more time testing the voice interaction, as opposed to the visual interaction design.</p>

                  <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <p>This project presents the design of a toy camera with tangible user interface called KidzEye. The main components of KidzEye includes both physical and digital interfaces. The physical interface is consisted of squishy material for children to grasp and squish to trigger the sensor for digital interaction. The digital interface design features are derived from observing the abilities, limitations and needs of pre-k children playing with some related products. The digital interface emphasizes the importance of visualization, feedback and guidance for children. Design principles were developed from several surveys and observation of use with the working prototypes.</p>

                  <h3>Why a Toy Camera</h3>
                  <p>From prior research, pre-K children have limitations on communication. I also found that children really like to take photos. They are curious about the image took from a camera.  This inspired me to think about if children could have a camera designed for their age specifically, this could help parents better understand their children by image recognition technologies and data analysis. The distance between parents and child could be shorten.</p>

                  <h3>User Testing & Insights</h3>
                  <p>Seven pre-K children had enrolled in the user tesing. I found the following insights: <br><br>For the physical interface, children loved soft and squishy material instead of rigid toy camera. They prefered brighter color such as yellow, instead of light blue. The organic squishy material could fits to all different hand size. The curve shape at the bottom of the camera could rest on their belly naturally. <br><br>For the digital interface, most pre-K children could perform simple finger motor skills on a touch screen, although some of them had a longer learning curve. It was hard for pre-K children to complete a task by more than two steps because children could have a hard time understanding the concept of layers and menu. </p>

                  <h2>Harman Kardon Remote</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Harman Kardon Remote is a mobile application for controlling Harman Kardon audio products. The main features included device control, music streaming, and music player.</p>

                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>Harman Kardon is a home audio system manufacturer. With the rise of smartphones, mobile-phone support for remote control and streaming services had become a must. In 2012, the Harman Kardon UI/UX design team began developing this application to give users a more simpler, more intuitive, and technologically integrated smarter way to interact with audio products.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Challenges</h3>
                  <p>Because of complex and meticulous nature of the project, detailed knowledge and execution was required. Designers researched and defined interactions for over ten Harmon Kardon products, including the BDS home-audio system and TK, in order to replicate and integrate these functions for mobile-phone remote control.<br><br>
                  In addition to the remote control, designers also develop a fully functioning music player integrating into the app. Another challenge was how we could implement a wide variety of setup processes while simultaneously improving on making the navigation, making the end result more intuitive, elegant, and easy to understand.</p>
